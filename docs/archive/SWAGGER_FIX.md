# Swagger UI Fix - White Screen Issue

## Problem
The Swagger UI at `/docs` was showing a white screen due to **Content Security Policy (CSP)** blocking external resources.

## Root Cause
The security headers middleware had a strict CSP that prevented Swagger UI from loading:
- JavaScript files from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`
- CSS files from CDN
- Fonts from Google Fonts

## Solution ✅
Modified `app/middleware/security_headers.py` to:
1. **Relax CSP for documentation endpoints** (`/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`)
2. **Allow CDN resources** for Swagger UI and ReDoc
3. **Keep strict CSP** for all other endpoints

### Changes Made

```python
# Before: Strict CSP for all endpoints
csp_directives = [
    "default-src 'self'",
    "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'",
    "connect-src 'self'",
    # ... blocked CDN resources
]

# After: Conditional CSP based on endpoint
if request.url.path in ["/docs", "/redoc", "/openapi.json"]:
    # Allow CDN for documentation
    csp_directives = [
        "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net",
        "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://fonts.googleapis.com",
        "font-src 'self' data: https://fonts.gstatic.com",
        # ...
    ]
else:
    # Strict CSP for API endpoints
    # ...
```

## How to Apply

1. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   
   # Start again
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)
   - Or clear cache in browser settings

3. **Test:**
   - Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
   - Should now load correctly with full UI

## Verification

After restart, check:
- ✅ Swagger UI loads completely
- ✅ All endpoints visible
- ✅ "Try it out" buttons work
- ✅ Schemas display correctly

## Security Note

This change:
- ✅ **Maintains security** for API endpoints (strict CSP)
- ✅ **Allows documentation** to load properly (relaxed CSP only for `/docs` and `/redoc`)
- ✅ **Only affects documentation pages**, not your actual API

The CSP is still strict for all API endpoints, maintaining security while allowing the documentation UI to function.

## Alternative: Disable CSP for Development

If you want to completely disable CSP during development, you can comment out the CSP header:

```python
# response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = "; ".join(csp_directives)
```

**Note:** Only do this in development, never in production!

**Status: ✅ FIXED**

Restart your server and refresh the browser to see the working Swagger UI!
